<h2>Overview of WebstaurantStore Test Suite and Framework 
<br>
Exercise and Project</h2>
<span>
I did not have time to try pulling this project into a fresh workspace to build it, and I haven't
<br>
worked much with Java projects to know what issues to anticipate. I targeted Java 1.8 because it
<br>
was an earlier version that I had installed that could maybe be easier to run. Please let me know
<br>
if there are any issues or there is anything I can do to make running this easier.
<p>
This is a framework and test suite proof of concept that I built from scratch, without copying from 
<br>
existing work. It was a crash course and great learning opportunity for me, setting up and learning:
<br>
&ensp;* Eclipse</t>
<br>
&ensp;* Maven
<br>
&ensp;* Java Selenium bindings
<br>
&ensp;* TestNG
<br>
&ensp;* Java nuances and best practices, since C#/.NET had been my primary tools previously.
</span>
<p>
General Implementation Notes:
<br>
&ensp;* This is just a partial implementation for an exercise, not necessarily representative of the
<br>
&emsp; design that may be implemented within a particular organization.
<br>
&ensp;* With the C# bindings, I had found that a generic explicit wait to find all elements removed the 
<br>
&emsp; need for sleeps, waiting to be sure the element has loaded, etc. I stuck with that concept here,
<br>
 &emsp; instead of moving to Page Factory using annotations. I also am not familiar with pros and cons of
<br>
 &emsp; initializing all the elements of a page, so for now I'm going with the most dynamic/flexible.
<br>
 &emsp; solution with which I am familiar. Having the methods to find elements centralized in this way
<br>
&emsp; could also be helpful in case anything needs to be added or changed in the find methods (for 
<br>
&emsp; stability, efficiency, possibly metrics, etc.).
<br>
&ensp;* I implemented my own helper utilities, but would first use utility classes already used by the
<br>
&emsp; organization. 
</p>
<p>
Possible improvements or areas to research, that will be out of scope (time) for the
initial version:
<br>
&ensp;* The framework would be in a separate project.
<br>
&ensp;* Look into use of modules if used by the organization.
<br>
&ensp;* Handle additional scenarios like sorting, accessibility, logged in user,
<br>
&emsp;  out of stock items, other preferences or setup, etc.
<br>
&ensp;* Investigate pros and cons of Page Factory using annotations
<br>
&ensp;* Determine the best way to pass test parameters in, which may be dependent on 
<br>
&emsp;  how the tests are executed and the practices/preferences of other developers.
<br>
&ensp;* Make processing of search results in a loop asynchronous, if realistic.
<br>
&ensp;* Discuss test reporting and notification needs and implement accordingly.
<br>
&ensp;* Replace hard-coded strings (e.g. environments = "prod") with consts, enums or
<br>
&emsp;  helper classes as appropriate.
<br>
&ensp;* Improve documentation, make comments more concise where possible.
<br>
&ensp;* Add highlighting of elements (using colored borders via JS) and screenshots.
<br>
&ensp;* Improve separation of duties between test and page classes if possible. The 
<br>
&emsp; page classes handle most page functionality, but the test grabs the entire list
<br>
&emsp; of results from it so it can loop through them.
<br>
&ensp;* Consider moving the dialog to add accessories to cart to its own page classes.
<br>
&ensp;* Improve readability, particularly of test steps and POM. Consider listing POM
<br>
&emsp; of results from it so it can loop through them.
<br>
&ensp;* Make sure objects and ideally process get cleaned up.
<br>
&ensp;* Adjust to any other standards or conventions within organization.
